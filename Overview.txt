Overview:
- Focused on flora/fauna surveying, since resources are known by default
- Free, no ads, no monetization
- Open source, fully offline, you own your data
- Celestial body survey progress tracks fauna/flora survey progress

Instructions:
- Installation options: Windows Store, Build your own from visual studio
- All user data is stored in app data local DataSlate.db
    - Existing default dataset may contain errors that will be fixed via app updates
    - Only edit the DB file directly if you know how sqlite works and how it can affect app compatibility

Potential features if people want them:
- Traits, but would like a comprehensive list of traits
- Adding searchable secondary resource drops for fauna loot
- Multiple resource search, along with other outpost planning functions
- Hardcore mode that logs 1 planet at a time instead of a 1 system at a time
- Prefilled 100% mode for users who prefer to use this as a wiki
